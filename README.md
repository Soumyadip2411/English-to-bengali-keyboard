English to Bengali Keyboard Mapping 📝➡️🅱️
This Python project enables real-time English-to-Bengali character mapping using a custom key mapping defined in a map.txt file. It allows users to type Bengali characters effortlessly by pressing corresponding English keys on their keyboard.

Features ✨
Real-time key mapping from English to Bengali.
Customizable mapping through an external map.txt file.
Handles special cases like : and punctuation.
Simple and efficient keyboard event handling using the keyboard library.
How It Works 🛠️
The script reads the map.txt file to load English-to-Bengali key mappings.
When a key is pressed, the script checks if the key exists in the mapping.
If mapped, the corresponding Bengali character is written. Otherwise, the key is processed normally.
